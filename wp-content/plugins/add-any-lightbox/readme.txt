Add any custom lightbox attribute to linked images or flash files in pages, posts and comments, supports grouping by ID.

== Description ==

Inspired by the Add Lightbox plugin, this plugin allows you to add any custom attribute (usually a rel or class) to linked images in 
pages, posts and comments, image formats supported are bmp, gif, jpeg, jpg and png. This can then be used with any of the popular 
lightbox plugins.

This does not include Javascript files for any lightbox plugins, these should be included yourself via your theme.

You can group images for each post by adding [id] into your rel or class and you can also add a custom attribute to 
linked Flash files (swf and flv).
